I wanted recently to give Fedora 21 a try and install it on my desktop and work laptop. Here are
some things to do after installation: 

* gnome-tweak-tool
* kernel 4.0.0 - if you have ATI graphics card - this will make its fan silent 
* vim-X11 and alias it in zsh/bash - to have X11 clipboard access
* elegance colors [https://github.com/satya164/elegance-colors]
